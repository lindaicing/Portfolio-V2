    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>A major issue that college students face is finding appropriate housing. Whether a student is forced to move due to roommate problems, or is transferring to a nearby school, finding available properties or lease transfers can be especially difficult. Dwella addresses this by allowing users to list and find properties in a certain location (or which fit certain search criteria).</p>

        <h3>Who</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Demographic:</strong> College students who want to get rid of their leases.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Demographic:</strong> Anyone seeking housing/leases, or who have other housing issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </span>

        <h3>Approach and Research</h3>
        <p>A persona was constructed to portray an "ideal user" of the app, and is shown below. A moodboard oriented towards the target audience was then developed. Housing sites (such as Air BnB, Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder, etc.) and apps were also examined to spot UI patterns.</p>

        <h3>User Screening</h3>
        <p>For outreach and screening, 4 individuals from 3 different age ranges <br>were surveyed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 51 year old experienced software engineer who lives in an apartment</li>
            <li>A 50 year old statistician, who uses their mobile device every day, living in a house</li>
            <li>A 21 year old student studying real estate, familiar with looking up property listings</li>
            <li>A 14 year old experienced social media user who lives in an apartment</li>
        </ul>
    </span>
    <span>
        <h3>Testing Setup</h3>
        <p>Before opening the prototype to allow users to interact with the application itself, I briefed them about the project as well as Dwella’s general purpose. In terms of moderation, I sat a little behind them so I could see their facial features and screen interactions. After observing their interactions, I took note of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any confusion in tapping/ interaction</li>
            <li>Speed and location of interactions</li>
            <li>Any changes in facial expression</li>
            <li>Any questions/feedback they had during/after the testing, as follow-up notes</li>
        </ul>
    </span>
</div>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Dwella was conceptualized to be an app used by people, particularly students, who need to transfer housing, sublease, or find subleased housing before official leases are over. It allows people to post properties, for lease-seekers to save listings, and for users to contact the posters.</p>
</div>

<p>Existing applications and organizations that partially solve the problem include Facebook Housing Groups (which gets confusing and content has little visibility since it gets easily lost as more content is uploaded), AirBnB (which is banned by many landlords from taking additional tenants into apartments), and SpareRoom (which only lists a couple cities like New York and LA, and doesn’t have as much of a student audience).</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Using feedback, the app's text sizing and typography was updated for better readability. Buttons and image editing handles were also made larger for better accessibility. Instructional overlays were also adjusted for more concise wording, which allowed users to properly follow directions without losing concentration. The “submit” button was changed to "post", since "post" has a greater connotation with the word “house.”</p>
