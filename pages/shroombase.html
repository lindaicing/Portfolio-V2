    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>To make fungi identification more accessible and easy to do. Itâ€™s difficult to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Know which trees are associated with which kind of fungi</li>
        <li>Know what type of mushroom</li>
        <li>See clearly the different characteristics of each part of the fruiting body of mushrooms</li>
        <li>Learn mycological jargon</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Who</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Demographic:</strong> Foragers and people curious about fungi, who want to learn more on how to identify certain species.</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary Demographic:</strong> Mycologists, foragers, and knowledgeable community members who want to contribute their findings to the resource.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>Currently there are many good fungi database sites, however most are hard to navigate and don't combine quality identifiable imagery with an easy-to-find search system. Many sites are strong in one aspect-- organizing fungi by name with scientific data, quality images but unorganized, or are great in both but have hard-to-find specimen articles. Some notable sites include the following resources:</p>
<div class="column">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/~bankeraceae.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First Nature Fungi</a> - Great organization but hard-to-see imagery and difficult to get a holistic understanding of specific specimens.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47170-Fungi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iNaturalist</a> - My favorite website, with a map to see all contributions/specimen spottings of users, with many high-quality observations. Fast way of getting ahold of the local community for identification, and also has machine learning to compare specimens to nearby ones. Drawbacks are that it is hard to compare specimens against each other, and waiting on community help can take a while. Mobile iOS app is not as easy to use as the desktop or Android versions.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.fungikingdom.net/fungi-photos--descriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fungi Kingdom</a> - Lots of information but design can be improved.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/mushroom-identification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mushroom Appreciation</a> - A sound resource for foragers, but scattered across multiple pages and articles are lengthy, so specific information is hard to find.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mushroom Expert</a> - One the best resources, but the interface is a bit difficult to focus on. Classification also uses scientific names, which can be confusing for beginners.</li>
        <li><a href="https://mushroommountain.com/meet-the-mushrooms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mushroom Mountain</a> - Good resource but no way to compare specific specimen attributes. Short entries with limited pictures.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://mushroomobserver.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mushroom Observer</a> - Slow to load site and grid items are lacking in categorization. Similar to iNaturalist but slower.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mycobank.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mycobank</a> - Interface is intimidating to use and get started with. Lacking in imagery and names are scientific. You really need to know what you're looking for.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mykoweb.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MykoWeb</a> - Good resource but lacking in pictures, and all names are categorized scientifically. Takes 3 clicks to see any images.</li>
        <li><a href="https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Department of Agriculture Fungal Database</a> - The hardest to use of any platform. UI is very bad, and performing a search is very difficult.</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia: Kingdom Fungi</a> - Wikipedia is awesome. It's extensive, there are experts fact-checking entries and updating frequently, but it's hard to compare different specimens sometimes, and difficult to filter search specific attributes of specimens (ex. color, seasonality, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Shroombase aims to simplify and create a visually-oriented profile system for select fungi, which can be understood by hobbyists and those new to the fungi world.</p>
</div>

<p>As of now, photos hosted on the site are a combo of personally taken and open source/attributed images. Many photos are from Wiki Commons, and fall under Creative Commons licenses (cited in the photo captions) or fall under public domain. By using both open source and personally taken photos, a more accurate picture of each specimen can be formed.</p>

<!-- V E R S I O N   1 ---------------------------------------->

<div class="highlight">
    <h3>Version 1</h3>
    <p>Version 1 started off as a photoblog of mushrooms I'd taken pictures of while on hikes. After getting curious about their identities, I started adding information about their characteristics, found locations, nomenclature, and fun tidbits. Rudimentary name searching and family tagging was created to quickly find certain species.</p>

    <h3>Version 2</h3>
    <p>Version 2 is the current version of the site. After wanting to know more about each mushroom and learning from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/blog/8680-an-inat-introduction-to-mushrooming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this guide</a> on iNaturalist on how to better present specimens for identification, it was clear that Version 1 was not structured in a way to easily see each specimen holistically. Version 2 includes a more in-depth front-end search capability, along with resources to learn more about fungi.</p>
